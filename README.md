# Run the Demo
To run the demo, follow these steps:

1. **Enter the `ikc` directory**: Navigate to the root directory of the `ikc` project.
2. **Start a local HTTP server**: Run a local HTTP server to serve the `index.html` file. You can use a tool like `http-server` or `python3 -m http.server 8001` to start a server.
3. **Open `index.html` in a web browser**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001` (or the port number specified by your HTTP server). This will load the `index.html` page, which is the entry point for the demo.

Once you've completed these steps, you should see the demo running in your web browser.
